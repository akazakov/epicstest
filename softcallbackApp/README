Test of dbCaPutCallback

On vxWorks boot from iocBoot/iocsoftcallback/st.cmd
On RTEMS boot common with CMDLINE iocBoot/iocsoftcallback/stcmd.host
On others
    cd iocBoot/iocsoftcallback
        ../../bin/<arch>/common stcmd.host

testDevAsyn

While the test is running you should see messages on the IOC console like:

[...]
Starting asynchronous processing: mrk:bodelay
Completed asynchronous processing: mrk:bodelay
Starting asynchronous processing: mrk:bodelay
Completed asynchronous processing: mrk:bodelay
Starting asynchronous processing: mrk:calcoutdelay
Completed asynchronous processing: mrk:calcoutdelay
Starting asynchronous processing: mrk:calcoutdelay
Completed asynchronous processing: mrk:calcoutdelay
[...]

while the client should just print:

[...]
Testing bo record ...
testDevAsyn OK
Testing calcout record ...
testDevAsyn OK
[...]


Details:


The following device support modules are tested:

devAoSoftCallback
devBoSoftCallback
devCalcoutSoftCallback
devLoSoftCallback
devMbboSoftCallback
devMbboDirectSoftCallback
devSoSoftCallback

For each three records are present. They are all similar. The ao records are:

record(ao,"mrk:aosyn")
{
    field(OUT,"mrk:aoasyn PP")
}
record(ao,"mrk:aoasyn")
{
    field(DTYP,"Async Soft Channel")
    field(OUT,"mrk:aodelay CA")
}
record(ao,"mrk:aodelay")
{
    field(DTYP,"Test Asyn")
    field(DISV,"1")
}

When a value is written to mrk:aosyn the following happens:

mrk:aosyn is processed and writes a value to mrk:aoasyn.
mrk:aoasyn processes. It does a CA put callback to mrk:aodelay.
mrk:aodelay has a delay of 1 second. Thus at the end we expect.

All three records will have the same value.

The time stamps for mrk:aoasyn and mrk:aodelay will be 1 seconds after
the time stamp for mrk:aosyn.

A Channel access client testPutCallback has been created to
check the above behavior. The shell script testDevAsyn jsut calls
it for each set of three records.
