This directory contains a database and command files for testing access
security.


SHORT INSTRUCTIONS:

IF YOU ARE NOT Andrew Johnson on uranus then you must modify
    the asSetSubstitutions (user, host, iocRemote) calls in
    st.accessLocal accessLocal.main acessTest.main (iocBoot/iocaccess)
    the test user and host arrays in asTest.c (src directory)
    and the access security files *.acf (acf directory)

    1) boot the local ioc (DO NOT boot remote IOC)
       vxWorks boot using st.accessLocal
       other platforms boot with
           ../../bin/<arch>/access accessLocal.main
    2) on host in iocBoot/iocaccess
           uranus% rm temp*
    3) on IOC execute the iocsh command
           epics> asTest "temp"
    4) on host issue the command
           uranus% diff asTest2006.11.27-anj temp
       No differences should be found.
    5) on IOC execute the iocsh command
           epics> asTrapWriteTest "temp1"
    6) on host issue the commands (Needs base/bin/<arch> in $PATH)
           uranus% sh asTrapWriteTest
           diff asTrapWriteTest2006.11.27-anj temp1
       No differences should be found IF you are anj on uranus
       OR you applied all the necessary changes mentioned above

To test between iocs

1) Boot both accessLocal and accessRemote
   a) For vxWorks boot using st.accessLocal and st.accessRemote
   b) For host use two different workstations. Start
      ../bin/<arch>/access accessRemote.main
      ../bin/<arch>/access accessLocal.main
2) Use medm to bring up the display adl/client.adl
   If you're using dm2k: the "-readonly" option does not work!

NOTE: The following only works on vxWorks

To test restarting access security (make sure medm display is running):

On local ioc execute the command:

sp asinittest,"../../accessApp/acf/local.acf","../../accessApp/acf/local2.acf"

On remote ioc execute the command:


sp asinittest,"../../accessApp/acf/remote.acf","../../accessApp/acf/remote2.acf"
