Change st.cmd to point to your log server machine.

ON HOST

cd logServer
Define the env parameter EPICS_BASE_BIN
rm iocLog
rc2.logServer start

The logServer can be stopped via the command:

rc2.logServer stop

ON IOC (On vxWorks make sure you are in iocsh)

generrMessage 1
generrlogPrintf 1
errlogTest 1

At any time console messages can be stopped by

eltc 0

and restarted by 

eltc 1

The following console command changes severity to log

errlogSetSevToLog <number>
