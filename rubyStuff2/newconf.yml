# So... the rigth way to configure all this stuff should be. 
# 1. Default config < Host Config 
# 2.
# 
# For example: Different hosts may have different location of base and other dirs. 
# But, depending on the current test case we may need some other directory definitions... 
# the question is were to put this data. 
#
# So now I think the configuration should consist from Hosts ( ips, architectures, default dirs etc...) 
# and testcases - where some test-by-test needed variables are defined.... and redefined. 
#
# As for the commands.... 
# the scenario is: we use two IOC and a few commands. so we want *easily* to switch from one host to another.... so how do we do this ?
# so we need to create aliases and use them to configure our test... 
# by default it would use some default hosts, but if we want we can change it. 
# So insise the test case configuration we specify its asliases and hosts. 
#  lets say we have [host1, hots2, hots3 ... hostN] 
#  and then in the test config we specify server1 = host1, server2 = host2, station0 = hostM 
#  and then we use it somehow like ioc1.start on server1 and ioc2.start on server2
#  and if we need to change it then we just change the aliasing -> server1 = hostN etc. 
# that's it. 
# 
# Old stuff.... reconsider
# All testCases need to include this part !!!!!!!!!!!!
